AI-powered stock market analysis and forecasting platform with production-ready MLOps infrastructure.

## Overview

FinanceML Pipeline is an end-to-end machine learning system that provides real-time stock market analysis, price forecasting, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization. The platform leverages LSTM neural networks for time-series prediction and integrates with financial data APIs to deliver actionable insights.

**Live Demo:** [https://financeml-frontend.onrender.com](https://financeml-frontend.onrender.com)

**API Documentation:** [https://financeml-api.onrender.com/docs](https://financeml-api.onrender.com/docs)

> **Note:** The application is hosted on Render's free tier. The first request after 15 minutes of inactivity may take 50-90 seconds to respond as the service spins up from sleep mode. Subsequent requests will be fast. This is a known limitation of free-tier hosting and does not reflect the application's actual performance capabilities.

## Deployment

### Render Configuration

The application is deployed on Render's free tier with automatic deployments from GitHub.

**Services:**
- API: Web service with Docker
- Frontend: Static site from build directory

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.9
PORT=8000
```

**Auto-deploy:** Enabled on main branch push

**Free Tier Limitations:**
- Services enter sleep mode after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Cold start time: 50-90 seconds for first request
- Monthly usage: 750 hours per service
- No persistent disk storage (cache stored in repository)
- Automatic shutdown and restart on inactivity

For production workloads, consider upgrading to paid tiers which offer:
- Always-on instances (no cold starts)
- Persistent storage
- Dedicated resources
- Custom domains with SSL

### Local Production Build

```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build

# Build Docker images
docker-compose build

# Deploy
docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=api --cov=models

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Load tests
python tests/load/locustfile.py
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# API Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000

# Data Sources
YAHOO_FINANCE_ENABLED=true
CACHE_ENABLED=true
CACHE_TTL=86400

# Model Configuration
MODEL_PATH=models/artifacts
PREDICTION_CONFIDENCE=0.95

# Monitoring
PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Cache Configuration

The system uses a two-tier caching strategy:
- **Level 1:** In-memory cache for API responses (5 min TTL)
- **Level 2:** File-based cache for market data (24 hour TTL)

Cache updates can be triggered manually:
```bash
python update_cache.py
```

## Performance Optimization

- Async API endpoints with FastAPI
- Database connection pooling
- Response caching layer
- Lazy model loading
- Batch prediction support
- Frontend code splitting
- CDN for static assets

## Security

- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting (100 requests/min)
- CORS configuration for production
- Environment variable management
- No sensitive data in logs
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
